Simply Readable
==============

[![Responsive Layout](http://i.imgur.com/XXHPktg.png, "Is it responsive?  You bet.")](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=http://roberthorvick.com)

Simply Readable is a Medium.com inspired theme with the goals of being easy to read and responsive to layout changes.

Right now the theme is hardcoded to my site.  If you want to use it you need to do the following:

1. Change the picture and bio information (grep for "Horvick")
2. Change the disqus settings in single.php (again, grep for "Horvick")
3. Uh ... I dunno.  Maybe other stuff.

I plan to make those things configurable - or maybe you want to help.
